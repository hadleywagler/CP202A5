            <br>
            <p class="text-faded mb-4">We are upper year students who attend Wilfrid Laurier University. Combined we have a strong variety of University experience and knowledge. We created this website with the goal to inform fellow Laurier students about EVERYTHING this school has to offer, both academically and socially. Transitioning to a large institution like Laurier usually overwhelms first years. We want to bring expert knowledge regarding day-to-day life at Laurier and the Waterloo community. We hope by doing this that people will maximize their time and not miss anything.
              <hr class="light my-4">
              <p class="text-faded mb-4">Everyone has a place at Laurier, and this is why we intend to target any student from 1st to 5th year. This website will inform every viewer on something new or at least promote specific things. Our content is mainly constructed from upper year students, and most of the advice is aimed at helping 1st and 2nd year students. It will not be specific to a certain program or age, and anyone attending Laurier or even in the Waterloo community will have access to this website and our resources will teach you more about life at WLU. Overall we want to be a popular online page were students can go if they have any problems or concerns regarding anything at Laurier. We will also offer a contact us page where students can provide their own advice as well as express misunderstandings with University life.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">What type of learner are you?</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">One of the first and most important tips for success in university is to understand the way in which you learn best. There are three different types of learners: visual, auditory and kinesthetic. Once you have determined which type of learner you are, taking action in how you study and using these methods are crucial.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Textbooks</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">Laurier students should be aware that there are other ways to access textbooks rather than paying full price at the bookstore. One way to do this is to buy used from the Laurier facebook pages available for students to join. One tip though is to look at the price in the bookstore and if there is an access code that you have to purchase for the course. Make sure that you aren’t overpaying for the textbook that would otherwise come with the access code from the bookstore.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Best Study Locations</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">According to a recent survey conducted, Laurier students find the best study locations on campus are the library, the science atrium and in Lazaridis, the new business building.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-3">Best Study Times</h3>
              <p class="text-muted mb-0">When it comes to finding the right time to claim your spot in one of these study areas, the earlier in the day you can make it the better. Especially during exams, if you want space on campus to study, going to sleep earlier so you can get up early is the best way to approach finding a seat.</p>
